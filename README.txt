Hello!! I am Ajay Anand..
This project is based on the billing system in the Supermarkets.
Made with the fundamentals of C++, including the file handling with ifstream()..
ifstream() helps us in storing the data, and retrieving whenever needed.
You can download the code and you can run in any "cpp" compiler.
